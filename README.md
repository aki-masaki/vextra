# Vextra

Vexta is a custom declarative UI language for building reactive web interfaces — without touching HTML, CSS, or JavaScript directly.
It’s minimal, high-contrast, and built for people who want control without the clutter of traditional component systems.

## The vision

I’m building Vexta to challenge how we think about front-end development.
I want Vextra to be:

- Declarative: UI is structured like a readable tree.

- Minimal: The output is pure HTML/CSS/JS, but stripped of everything unnecessary.

- Minimalistic ui: Clutter distracts you from the main point.

- Flexible: You can build simple pages, full apps all in one syntax.

- Custom: It’s its own language. Styling, state, and logic live together, but without feeling bloated or coupled.

## Goals 

Custom parser + transpiler from `.vex` files to HTML, CSS, Javascript, all done with a simple command.
